This is a task manager that I created the search input is still not working and no users yet just a frontend but I will add that feature when I'm not busy. I created this to practice and understand how and where the data was going I am just curious and eager to know that. what I learned on this project is how localStorage work how display grid behaves and all the positioning how to put them in the right place and how to structure the javaScript callbacks and functions I have learned so many things on this project I can't write it all because you maybe get bored reading it but thank you for reading.
